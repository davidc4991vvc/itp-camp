Sooo... these sessions are going to be geared towards beginners. We're going to be using JavaScript to learn about:

* control structures like loops and conditionals
* functions
* objects and arrays
* maybe messing around with a web page's elements (DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript)
* or drawing stuff by playing around with canvas
* ooooor making some noise with the web audio api
